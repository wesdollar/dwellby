# Welcome to Dwellby!

Started on March 26

Dwellby is a pet project made by the married couple over at [DollarDojo.tech](https://DollarDojo.tech). The entire development of this project is being live streamed on the DollarDojo Twitch!

Dwellby is a simple, quick way to keep track of tasks that need to be done around the house. It's more so a portfolio piece than anything else and a mechanism for us to learn new technologies. We hope to be launching soon. In the meantime, come play with us on DollarDojo Twitch or in Discord for all the latest and greatest news! Plus, our community is dope af.

We aren't currently accepting new users, but all subscribers of the DollarDojo Twitch channel can request access via the DollarDojo Discord.
